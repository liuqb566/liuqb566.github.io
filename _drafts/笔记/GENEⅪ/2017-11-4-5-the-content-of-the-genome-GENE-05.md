### 5.3 Individual Genomes Show Extensive Variation

A locus is usually defined as polymorphic if **two or more alleles** are present at **a frequency of > 1%** in the population.

The wild type may itself be polymorphic. 

There may be a variety of changes at a locus,including:
- change the DNA sequence but do not change the sequence of the polypeptide product
- change the polypeptide sequence without changing its function
- result in polypeptides with different functions
- result in altered ploypeptides that are nonfunctional

### 5.4 RFLPs and SNPs Can Be Used for Genetic Mapping 

*Haplotype*: The **particular combination** of sites found in a specific region and represents a small portion of the complete genotype.

### 5.5 Eukaryotic Genomes Contain Nonrepetitive and Repetitive DNA Sequences

*Transposons*: also be viewed as selfish DNA or junk DNA, which is defined as sequences that propagate htemselves within agenome without contributing to the development and functioning of the organism.

Selective forces do not act against transposons. It may be that they are selectively neutral as long as they do not interrupt or delete coding or regulatory regions.

Qusetion:

1. How to identify transposons?
2. What role do they play in revolution?

### 5.6 Eukaryotic Protein-Coding Genes Can Be Identified by the Conservation of Exons

In a region **containing a gene** whose function has been conserved among a range of species,the sequence representing the polypeptide should have **two distinctive properties**:

1. It must have an **open reading frame**.
2. It is likely to have a related (**orthologous**)sequence in other species.

### 5.7 The Conservation of Genome Organization Helps to Identify Genes

In the **simplest cases**, the first and last exons contain the start and end of the coding region,respectively (as well as the 5' and 3' untranslated regions)

In **more complex cases**, the first or last exons may have **only untranslated regions** and may therefore be more difficult to identify.
