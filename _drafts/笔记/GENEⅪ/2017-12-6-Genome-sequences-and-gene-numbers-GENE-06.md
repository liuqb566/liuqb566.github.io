### 6.1 Introduction

Perhaps the single most important piece of information provided by a genome sequence is **the number of genes**.

### 6.2 Prokaryotic Gene Numbers Range Over an Order of Magnitude 

### 6.4 How Many Different Types of Genes Are There?

Two factors that can cause the proteome to be different from the total gene number:

1. genes cab be duplicated

2. some genes can produce more than one polypeptide by alternative splicing or other means.

Operationally, wo usually consideer that two genes in different organisms are **orthologs** if their sequences are similar over **~80%** of the length.

The number of **pseudogenes** can be large, the number of pseudogenes is **~10%** of the number of (petentially) functional genes in moutse and human genomes.

Some of these pseudogenes may serve the function of producing regulatory **microRNAs**.

### 6.5 The human genome has fewer genes than originally expected 

### 6.6 How are genes and other sequences distributed in the genome?

Repetitive sequences fall into five classes:
  1. Transposons(45%)
  2. Processed pseudogenes(0.1%)
  3. SSR(3%)
  4. Segmental duplications(5%)
  5. Tandem repeats form blocks of one type of sequence.

Interesting:

- Some **currently functional genes** originated as **transposons** and evolved into their present condition after losing the ability to transpose.(Are Transposons for adapting env or just happend occurently? and how to analysis?)

- Diploid genome -> duplicated -> Tetraploid -> evolve differences -> Diploid -> duplicated -> tetraploid (Is cotton? how to analysis?)

- In the human genome, the presence of sequences that do not appear to have coding functions but show an evolutionary **conservation higher** than the background level?(What's their role? how to analysis?)
